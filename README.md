# Advent of Code 2022

This repository implements the solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles in C++ and in Python.


## C++ Solutions

The `c++` folder implements a solution of the puzzles in C++20.  
It contains one binary for each day, with a .cpp file and a .h header for part 1 and part 2.  
The binaries are built with CMake. 

See the [C++ README](https://github.com/Moremar/advent_of_code_2022/tree/main/c%2B%2B) for details on how to run it on Windows and Unix.


## Python Solutions 

The `python` folder implements a solution of the puzzles in Python 3.  
It contains 2 scripts per day : one for part 1 and one for part 2.

See the [Python README](https://github.com/Moremar/advent_of_code_2022/tree/main/python) for details on how to run it on Windows and Unix.
